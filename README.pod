=head1 DESCRIPTION

Data::PcAxis is a module for extracting data (and metadata) from PC-Axis files.

PC-Axis is a file format format used for dissemination of statistical information. The format is used by a number of national statistical organisations to disseminate national statistics.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

     my $px = Data::PcAxis->new('path/to/pcaxis/file');

Creates a new Data::PcAxis object. Takes the path (relative or absolute) to the PC-Axis file that will be represented by the object.

=head2 metadata

     my $hashref = $px->metadata; //

Returns a hashref containing the PC-Axis file's metadata. Each of the returned hashref's keys is a metadata keyword from the original PC-Axis file, each of its values is a hashref. Where a keyword in the original PC-Axis file had a single string value (meaning that the value applied to the entire dataset --- e.g. the 'TITLE' keyword), then that keyword's hashref contains a single key, 'TABLE', the value of which is the string to which that keyword pointed to in the original PC-Axis file.

=head2 keywords

    my @keywords $px->keywords;

Returns an array containing all of the metadata keywords associated with the PC-Axis datasets currently represented by the object.

=head2 keyword

   my $value = $px->keyword('TITLE'); // Returns the value of the 'TITLE' keyword

The keyword method returns the value of the passed keyword. If the keyword holds a value which refers to the entire table (such as the 'TITLE' keyword), then that value is returned as a string. If the keyword passed to the method has different values for each variable (for example, the 'VALUES' and 'CODES' keywords will have a different list of values for each variable), then a hashref pointing to the entire set of values is returned by the method.

=head2 variables

    my $num_vars = $px->variables; // scalar context
    my @vars = $px->variables; // list context

In a scalar context the variables method returns the number of variables represented in the dataset.

In a list context the method returns an array containing the variable names. The variables in the returned array are ordered as they are in the PC-Axis file; first the 'STUB' variables, followed by the 'HEADING' variables.

=head2 var_by_idx

    my $var_name = $px->var_by_idx($idx);

Returns the variable name, at the index passed, in an array composed of [ STUB variables, HEADING variables ], that is the array returned by Data::PcAxis->variables;

=head2 var_by_rx

    my $index = $px->var_by_rx($pattern);

Returns the index in an array composed of [ STUB variables, HEADING variables ], that is the array returned by Data::PcAxis->variables, of the first variable the name of which matches the passed pattern.

=head2 vals_by_idx

    my $val_names = $px->vals_by_idx($var_idx);

Takes a variable index and returns a reference to an array containing the names of all possible values for the variable represented by that index. The order of the values in the array matches the order in the original file. The order will also match that of arrayrefs returned by C<Data::PcAxis->codes_by_idx>, C<Data::PcAxis->vals_by_name>, and C<Data::PcAxis->codes_by_name>.

=head2 codes_by_idx

    my $val_codes = $px->codes_by_idx($var_idx);

Returns a reference to an array containing the codes for all of the possible values of the variable passed. The order of the codes in the array matches the order in the original file. The order will also match that of arrayrefs returned by C<Data::PcAxis->vals_by_idx>, C<Data::PcAxis->vals_by_name>, and C<Data::PcAxis->codes_by_name>.

=head2 vals_by_name

    my $val_names = $px->vals_by_name($var_name);

=head2 codes_by_name

    my $val_codes = $px->codes_by_name($var_name);

=head2 val_counts

    my $counts = $px->val_counts;

=head2 val_by_code

    my $val_name = $px->val_by_code($var_name, $val_code);

=head2 code_by_val

    my $val_code = $px->code_by_val($var_name, $val_name);

=head2 datapoint

    my $datum = $px->datapoint(@indices);

=head2 datacol

    my $datacol = $px->datacol(['*', $idx_1, $idx_2, $idx_n]);

=head2 dataset

    my $dataset = $px->dataset(['*', '*', $idx_2, $idx_n], 0);
